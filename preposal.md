## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO I have an Idea of making a calucaltor for chemistry. Specifically for the periodic table.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO I am doing this project individually.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO How big should the project be? I think I am only capable of making a calculator that gives you one or two aspects of an element.
